- Like Cyfaraun, Siadanos is an old elven town captured during
  the Argollëan War. Situated on the east bank of the Mirmen
  River, Siadanos controls the trade route between the dwarven
  stronghold of Azen Radokh and the northern cities of Cyfaraun,
  Pyrgos, and Larisa. It is also the supply base for the southwest
  stretch of the Unbroken Line, from Türos Tem to Türos Tellë.
  Since the legions were called west two years ago, supplying the
  garrisons has become much less lucrative and Siadanos has fall-
  en on hard times. The local crime syndicate has begun to ex-
  ploit the situation to seize control of the military trade. In recent
  weeks, the merchant caravans to Türos Tem have come under
  attack from beastmen marauders striking from the Viaspen
  Forest (see the Buried Temple at #27) while hobgoblins from
  the Meniri Mountains have recently occupied nearby Dragon’s
  Tor (#33) and undead wandering north from the sinkhole in
  the Lusaun Forest (#35) are an ongoing threat. The Palatine of
  Siadanos, Theremus Augilian, would welcome the assistance of
  adventurers.
