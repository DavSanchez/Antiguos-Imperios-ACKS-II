- Türos Tem es parte de la línea de fortalezas construida hace 150 años por el entonces Cetranar de Címbar, Audarius Ulkyreus, para proporcionar una defensa ante los invasores [[hombres bestia]] de más allá del [[Muro Oscuro]]. Se asienta sobre un pico rocoso y escarpado Türos Tem is part of the line of forts built 150 years ago by
  Tarkaun Audarius XI Ulkyreus to provide a forward defense
  against beastman invaders from beyond the Dark Wall. It sits
  atop a sheer-walled 150’ tall tor between the Krysivor River and
  Viaspen Forest. In recent weeks, beastmen raiders somehow
  gained a foothold in the Viaspen Forest to the fort’s north, from
  which they have begun striking at the nearby settlements. Local
  farms and hamlets have been sacked and pillaged, and entire
  families have gone missing. Even the regular merchant caravans
  from the nearby town of Siadanos have come under attack. The
  number and frequency of these occurrences point to a threat
  beyond a simple nomadic group of beastmen. Legate Ulrand
  Valerian, commander of Türos Tem, has too few men to patrol
  the border; he has none at all to hunt down beastmen hidden in
  the dense forest. He has offered a reward of 2,000gp to anyone
  who can uncover the nature of the threat and end it. (Türos Tem
  is detailed in AX1: The Sinister Stone of Sakkara. See also the
  Buried Temple at #27.)
